# The Quick Map Services Plugin {#tutorial-qms}

This tutorial will introduce you to another online resource: tiled maps. These are often not great for publishing maps, but can be very helpful when exploring data, and trying to make sure all data align. These services also occasionally provide satellite imagery. This functionality depends on the [Quick Map Services plugin](http://nextgis.com/blog/quickmapservices/), which we will have to install from the QGIS Plugins repository. To install the plugin, choose *Manage and Install Plugins...* from the *Plugins* menu.

## Purpose

* Demonstrate the installation use of the Quick Map Services plugin
