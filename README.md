# Canadian QGIS Introduction

This repository contains a [bookdown](http://bookdown.org) document that contains course material for a Canada-specific QGIS introductory course. The document is ongoing, and is intended to be based on QGIS 3.0, set for release sometime later this year.

The document is in its early stages, but contributions are welcome. The material is based on course material for a two-day short course, which is [also available on github](https://github.com/paleolimbot/QGIS-Intro-Course). It is based on the [minimal bookdown example](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo).
