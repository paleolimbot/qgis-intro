Dunnington 2017-04-29 Introduction TODO: write this section 0.1 Prerequisites This course uses QGIS and Canadian examples to give a brief introduction to geographic information systems. QGIS is an open-source GIS platform available for all major platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX. This course was written using QGIS 2.18.2 for Mac OSX, however it is expected that this tutorial is valid from QGIS 2.14 up to future versions of QGIS. To use this course, you will need to install QGIS and download the course data. 0.1.1 Installing QGIS QGIS downloads are available from the QGIS download page (http://qgis.org/download). Instructions on the website are fairly complete, but the process is slightly different based on platform. 0.1.1.1 Windows TODO: write this section 0.1.1.2 MacOSX TODO: write this section 0.1.1.3 Linux TODO: write this section 0.1.2 Course Data This course uses a series of minimal examples to illustrate common tasks in QGIS. The data for these examples is available for download at the tutorial website (http://qgis-intro.paleolimbot.github.io/qgis-intro.zip). You should extract this ZIP file to location you can find easily before starting this course (I use the Desktop; you can always move the course folder somewhere else later). 0.2 Philosophy There are many excellent reference guides to QGIS, and much high-quality coures material available for teaching GIS and learning QGIS software. This course is designed to be a lightweight introduction to QGIS software to build a basic proficiency in GIS and GIS software, using Canadian examples and data to illustrate key concepts. This material is designed for a two-day short-course format. 0.3 Structure The course is divided into three parts. The first is a textual introduction to GIS and QGIS, the second is a set of tutorials that will walk you through the creation of several common types of maps. Finally, there is a quick reference section that provides short tutorials for common tasks (e.g., adding a vector layer). 0.4 Conventions Throughout this course we will use bold text to refer to terms that are in the glossary (like GIS or vector layer), italic text to refer to QGIS menu options or window titles (such as the Style tab or Layers Panel), “quotations” to refer to layer names (such as “buildings_poly”), and preformatted text to refer to filenames (such as 02 Map of Canada/Canada-WGS84.shp). 0.5 Acknowledgments TODO: write this section Course participants EES, esp. Lynn Graves and Ian Spooner Lita, Jon, &amp; Karissa for TAing the class This course material was written using the bookdown package inside RStudio. Pages were generated using pandoc and gitbook. The source is available on github. "],

You can download the shapefiles by country or the whole world if you have a lot of time and a lot of disk space. Several Canadian files are included in this tutorial. These files are for personal or academic use only. Level 0 is countries, level 1 is provices/states, and level 2 is counties. 3.2 The Atlas of Canada The Atlas of Canada 1:1,000,000 scale dataset is particularly good for Canada-wide maps, as they reflect the zoomed-out nature of these maps and include all of the layers needed to produce a nice-looking map of Canada. You can find a QGIS Project with most of the layers you will need on GitHub (created by me a long time ago), or you can get the original data on GeoGratis. 3.3 CanVec Data CanVec is the (Canadian) national vector dataset used to create NRCan Topographic Maps (1:50,000 scale). This data is ideal for local-scale maps, such as a map of Wolfville. A county-wide map is probably about as widespread as you will want to go using this dataset, since it is quite detailed and the files can be large. You can get this data from the GeoGratis Data Extractor, along with low-resolution digital elevation models. 3.4 GeoGratis GeoGratis is a multi-purpose geospatial data warehouse for Government of Canada datasets. These datasets are often quite good, although they can be dated (NRCan takes a very serious approach to data validation, which means by the time everything is validated, the maps are ironically out of date). 3.5 Provincial Sources 3.5.1 Nova Scotia 3.5.1.1 GeoNova The equivalent to GeoGratis in Nova Scotia is GeoNova, which is a general-purpose spatial data warehouse for the province of Nova Scotia. It is somewhat difficult to navigate, but includes some valuable datasets like the Nova Scotia forestry inventory and high-resolution DEM layers. Tiled 1:10,000 topographic information can be found in the Data Locator. The Geospatial Data Directory lets you download these these layers province-wide in high resolution, which will take a lot of your time and disk space. It’s probably better to stick with the tiled datasets unless you have grand plans to create a province-wide atlas. Note that some ZIP archives put out by GeoNova require something called “P7ZIP” if you are running Mac OS. 3.5.1.2 Nova Scotia DNR Data The Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources has some excellent data that is often published alongside its paper maps and written publications. They have an excellent GIS Data section on their website. "],
["creating-maps-in-qgis.html", "Chapter 4 Creating Maps in QGIS", " Chapter 4 Creating Maps in QGIS Throughout this course you will use the same steps to create a map. Prepare your data Add your data to QGIS Make sure your layer CRS values are correct, and choose a project CRS Make your map look pretty Use a Print Composer to export your map We will introduce these steps not in the order listed above, but in order of difficulty (more or less). In Chapter 5 you will learn how to add data to the map, change the Project CRS, and use the Print Composer to export a map from QGIS; in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 you will learn how to style vector layers; in Chapter 8 and Chapter 10 you will learn how to download freely available GIS data from the internet and prepare our own data to import to QGIS. In Chapter 11 you will practice these five steps by creating a minimalist study stue map, and in Chapters 12 and 13 you will learn how to create, edit, and process vector and raster layers. "],
